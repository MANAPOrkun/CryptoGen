CRYPTOGEN Cryptology Algorithm

Symmetric block algorithm with 64 bit key which can pass frequency analysis and kasiski analysis.

In this project :
*we block the plain text in 256 bit form.
*we specialize genetic algorithm to satisfy our needs.
*we transpose the matrix in diagonal arrows by the key.
*we loop the transposition 3 times
*we XOR with the key in 64-bit form.
